This chapter along with the remaining chapters will guide you through how to make your ecommerce website functional. We will be adding a shopping cart functionality where users can add and remove items from their cart.

 For simplicity, we will have the shopping cart page on the same page where the moods are displayed.

# Adding Items to Cart

Our shopping cart will be located in the footer of our ecommerce page.

We will add a footer element in our html.
>[action]
> Add a footer element after the main element inside your ```index.html``` file
>
```html
<footer>
</footer>
```

Your HTML markup should now look like this:

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Groceries</title>
  <link rel='stylesheet' href='./resources/css/styles.css'>
</head>
<body>
  <header class='page-header'>
    <h4>The Mood Shop</h4>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Cart</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main class='items' id='items'>
    <!--
      Display moods here
     -->
  </main>
  <footer>
  </footer>
  <script src='./resources/js/scripts.js' type="module"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Follow this shopping cart tutorial to add the shopping cart functionality.

The tutorial is slightly different, but we're essentially using the same functionality of the shopping cart tutorial.

In the video tutorial, all code is written inside ```index.html```. But since we have a separate ```scripts.js``` file, we'll write the javascript code in there instead of inside the ```<script>``` tag.

You can write the javascript functions below the code you wrote for displaying moods in ```scripts.js``` file.
