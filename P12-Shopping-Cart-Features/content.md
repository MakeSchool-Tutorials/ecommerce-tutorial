In this last chapter, we will be finishing up the shopping cart functionality.

So far our cart has been connected with the e-commerce page and 'Add to cart' buttons attached to each items.

It would also be nice if we can update the quantity of selected item, and remove an item from our cart.

# Adding "Remove items" button to our Shopping Cart

## 11th Video (Start from 2:25 - end)

Follow this video **starting at 2:25** implement "Remove items" button to our shopping cart. Here you will create a remove item button for each item displayed in the cart.

At the start the video is slightly different but you will be implementing the same functionality throughout the video.

## Stretch Challenge:

> - Style the shopping cart (CSS)
> - Style all the buttons inside the shopping cart (CSS)
> - Remove the dots on the list of items in the shopping cart (CSS)
> - Customize your Mood Shop by changing the theme of the navbar, body and footer (CSS)
> - In the navbar, there is a link called 'cart'. Currently if you click on it, it doesn't do anything. Connect the link to the shopping cart so that when a user clicks on cart, it takes them to the footer where the cart is located.
