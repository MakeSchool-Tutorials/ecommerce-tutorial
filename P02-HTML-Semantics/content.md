In this Chapter we will be using: **HTML** and **CSS**

## What is HTML?

HTML is short for "HyperText Markup Language". That may sound scary, but it simply means it is a language for describing web-pages using ordinary text.

## What is an HTML tag?

HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.

Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, **```<html>```** is the opening tag and **```</html>```** is the closing tag. Note that the closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash ( / ) character.

## What are tag attributes?

Attributes allow you to customize a tag, and are defined within the opening tag, for example: `<img src="image1.jpg">` or `<p class="lead"> ... </p>`. Here for **img** tag, the attribute is **src**, which defines where the source file of the image is located. For the **p** tag the attribute **class** defines the name of the style group that should be applied to this elemwnt.

# Let's start by making the landing (shopping) page for our website.

First, let's have the basic outline/boilerplate for HTML.

You can learn more about the outline here: [HTML template](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title of the document</title>
</head>

<body>
  The content of the document......
</body>
</html>
```

The first line, ```<!DOCTYPE>``` is called **Document Type Declaration**. It tells the browser what kind of document it's looking at. In our case, it's telling the browser that our document is an Html file.

Next is the ```<html>``` tag which contains the head tag and body tag.

The head tag contains the title of our page, ```<title>```. This is also the place where we would link up an external stylesheet. (Which we will be doing later on in the upcoming chapters).

The ```<body>``` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, **images**, **hyperlinks**, **tables**, **lists**, etc. We also link our **javascript** file here. 

The head tag contains information about the document, while the body tag contains everything that you'll see in the browser. 

# Displaying our 'Hello World'

Let's start by displaying 'Hello World' in our browser.

> [action]
>
> In `index.html`, add a paragraph tag (```<p>```) inside the body tag. Inside the paragraph tag, write, Hello World!
>
```html
<p> Hello World </p>
 ```
>
> open your file in the browser now. Let's assume you're using Chrome. Do open the file in your browser, follow the steps below:
>
> 1. Choose File from the Chrome ribbon menu.
> 1. Then select Open File.
> 1. Navigate to your HTML file location, highlight the document and click Open.
> 1. You will see your file open in a new tab.
>
> You should see 'Hello World'.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You just displayed text in your browser.
